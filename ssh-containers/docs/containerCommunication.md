### Container communication

This diagram aims to show the communication for a fabric created with SSH containers.  Looking at the legend on the left will show the ports and colour coordination.  The most common cause of issues when setting up a fabric using the SSH comnands are when there are firewals preventing traffic on these [ports](http://fabric8.io/gitbook/sshContainers.html#ports).
