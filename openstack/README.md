## OpenStack automation scripts

Scripts for different technologies for automating testing/Continuous Delivery on OpenStack

Here are some example scripts you can use to provision openstack machines (IaaS.. should work on Amazon EC2 also) to be able to run Fabric8.

* [Ansible](ansible): use SSH to configure and manage fabric8 on a set of existing VMS (sets up required tools, firewalls, deploys fabric8, etc)
* [OpenStack JClouds](openstack-jclouds): use the jclouds project to spin up VMs and deploy fabric8
