## vagrant example scripts

To use any of these scripts you should [install vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) on your box

* [bash](bash/Vagrantfile) uses plain bash so doesn't require anything else to be installed other than vagrant.
* ansible using Anisble with vagrant
* chef using Chef

### Logins

The usual login/pwd of the VMs created is usually:

* user: **root**
* password: **vagrant**
